**API URL**: ``https://fates-api.select-list.xyz``

**Widgets Documentation:** ``https://fates-lynx.select-list.xyz/widgets`` 

## Authorization

- **Bot:** These endpoints require a bot token. 
You can get this from Bot Settings. Make sure to keep this safe and in 
a .gitignore/.env. A prefix of `Bot` before the bot token such as 
`Bot abcdef` is supported and can be used to avoid ambiguity but is not 
required. The default auth scheme if no prefix is given depends on the
endpoint: Endpoints which have only one auth scheme will use that auth 
scheme while endpoints with multiple will always use `Bot` for 
backward compatibility

- **Server:** These endpoints require a server
token which you can get using ``/get API Token`` in your server. 
Same warnings and information from the other authentication types 
apply here. A prefix of ``Server`` before the server token is 
supported and can be used to avoid ambiguity but is not required.

- **User:** These endpoints require a user token. You can get this 
from your profile under the User Token section. If you are using this 
for voting, make sure to allow users to opt out! A prefix of `User` 
before the user token such as `User abcdef` is supported and can be 
used to avoid ambiguity but is not required outside of endpoints that 
have both a user and a bot authentication option such as Get Votes. 
In such endpoints, the default will always be a bot auth unless 
you prefix the token with `User`. **A access token (for custom clients)
can also be used on *most* endpoints as long as the token is prefixed with 
``Frostpaw``**

- **Special:** These endpoint employ their own authentication system (such as ``slwebset``)

## Base Response

## Create Server Vote
### PATCH `https://fates-api.select-list.xyz`/users/{user_id}/servers/{server_id}/votes

This endpoint creates a vote for a server which can only be done *once* every 8 hours
and is independent from a bot vote.
                    
**Query Parameters**

- **test** => bool [true]




**Path Parameters**

- **user_id** => i64 [0]
- **server_id** => i64 [0]





**Response Body**

- **done** => bool [false]
- **reason** => (Optional) string ["Why the vote failed or any extra info to send to client if the vote succeeded"]
- **context** => (Optional) string ["Some context on the vote"]



**Response Body Example**

```json
{
    "done": false,
    "reason": "Why the vote failed or any extra info to send to client if the vote succeeded",
    "context": "Some context on the vote"
}
```


**Authorization Needed** | [User](#authorization)


## Get Bot Votes
### GET `https://fates-api.select-list.xyz`/users/{user_id}/bots/{bot_id}/votes

Endpoint to check amount of votes a user has.

- votes | The amount of votes the bot has.
- voted | Whether or not the user has *ever* voted for a bot in the past 8 hours.
- timestamps | A list of timestamps that the user has voted for the bot on that has been recorded.
- expiry | The time when the user can next vote.
- vote_right_now | Whether a user can vote right now. Currently equivalent to `vote_epoch < 0`.

- Unlike API v2, this *does not* require authorization to use. This is to speed up responses and 
because the last thing people want to scrape are Fates List user votes anyways. **You should not rely on
this however, it is prone to change *anytime* in the future and may return bogus results for privacy purposes**.
- ``vts`` has been renamed to ``timestamps``

**This endpoint will return bogus data if "Hide votes to other users" is enabled**

**Path Parameters**

- **user_id** => i64 [0]
- **bot_id** => i64 [0]





**Response Body**

- **votes** => i64 [10]
- **voted** => bool [true]
- **vote_right_now** => bool [false]
- **expiry** => u64 [101]
- **timestamps** => (Array) string ["1970-01-01T00:00:00Z"]



**Response Body Example**

```json
{
    "votes": 10,
    "voted": true,
    "vote_right_now": false,
